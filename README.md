# Simple Banking Web Application

This is a basic front-end banking application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project simulates common banking operations such as:

- Opening a new bank account
- Depositing funds
- Withdrawing money
- Checking account balance
- Viewing mini statements

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean layout with clearly labeled buttons and input forms.
- **Form Handling**: Each operation uses a separate form for data input.
- **Dynamic Form Display**: Only the selected operationâ€™s form is visible at a time.
- **Responsive Design**: Simple styling for a pleasant user experience.
- **Alert-Based Submission**: Simulated form submission using `alert()` popups.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Click on a button (e.g., "Open Account") to fill and submit a form.

> Note: This is a front-end only demo. No backend or database functionality is included.

## Future Enhancements

- Add data validation and input restrictions
- Store and retrieve form data using local storage or backend
- Implement real transaction logic with a server
- Improve mobile responsiveness
